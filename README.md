# BoredNoMore
This app is inteneded to eliminate boredom from everybody's lives. No matter who you are, you don't need to be bored. There is ALWAYS something to do or to learn, no matter where you are. Thanks to the internet, everything is available.

I use the mern-boilerplate API to help with back-end routing and to get started.
React is used to render the page.
I use good enough recommendations on the backend to get a list of recommendations. Google Places is used for suggestions on the site itself.
